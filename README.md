Anvils only allow items to be combined if the cost is less than `40` levels. Otherwise the **Too Expensive!** message is displayed. This leads to a complicated order of combining books to get the best gear before you can't add any more enchantments.

This mod replaces the arbitrary value of `40` levels with `2147483647` (the maximum value of a Java Integer). By default costs of using anvils are not changed and the scaling remains the same.

A config menu allows to set the maximum level cost, the anvil break chance, a level cost cap, and the cost increase rate. Mod Menu is optional, but required to access the config menu.
